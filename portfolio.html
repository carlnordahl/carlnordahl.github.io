                    <h3 class="negative-margin">Java, FXML</h3>
                    <p>Rant is intended as a social media platform where users can unleash their true feelings and rant 
                        about anything and everything that bothers or amuses them at the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>I wrote Rant in Java. I used FXML and Scenebuilder to create the graphics of the application. 
                        To make the server, I used the Spring framework. Lastly, I made the database in MySQLWorkbench. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        As of now, Rant is a local application, the server and database exists only on my computer. My reason 
                        for making Rant was to learn how to build an application with Java, and to get some understanding of 
                        how the interaction between a server, a database and a client works. But it is not finished. I would 
                        like to keep working on it and eventually publishing it for people to use.

                    <h3 class="negative-margin">Python</h3>
                    <p>I made my own version of the popular card game "Memory". Memoree is a single player game 
                        in which the user has to find and memorize matching cards by flipping them over, two at a time. 
                        To make the game more interesting, I added difficulty levels to the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>Memoree is written in Python. I used the PyGame framework to make the game. At the time of making 
                        the game, I hadn't used Python in about a year. So other than being a fun project Memoree was a 
                        way for me to get familiar with Python again.

                                Designing the game was really entertaining. I wanted it to have a retro look, which I think the thick, 
                                black border edges of the buttons and cards portrayed. There are three animations in the game: Setting 
                                up the board, winning and losing. The purpose of them was to make the game feel more immersive.

                                This demo is played in medium difficulty, which means that the player has five minutes to win 
                                the game. The cards' positions are randomised each new game. The game esentially works by keeping 
                                one list of the icons on each card, and one list of each card's coordinates. When two cards are 
                                reavealed and a third one is pressed an algorithm checks if the two revealed cards have the same 
                                icons by getting the index of their coordinates in the coordinates list and comparing the icons 
                                at the same indexes in the icons list.

                    <p>carlnordahl.com is the website which you are currently visiting. It is my first website project and it 
                        started with me wanting to learn HTML.
                         Creating a portfolio website was the perfect project and a personal goal of mine. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It has been an enjoyable project. I really like web development because of the instant feedback loop. 
                        Seeing the website taking form with every new line of code in real time is great.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My plan is to of course keep updating carlnordahl.com. Partly by adding new project and partly by 
                        upgrading the design and feel of the site as I get more comfortable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                    <p>In TicTacToe, the player plays as "X" against the computer, "O". The computer will pick a random square

                    </p>
                    <p>I used Java to write TicTacToe. The graphics of the game were made using the JavaSwing framework. 
                        I only spent one day on this project, hence why the design is very basic.
